This script is for frontend react projects! it will clone the project and automatically copy the correct node modules into the project so you don't have to keep running `npm install`. 

after cloning, call the script like this:

```
./grading.sh <url> <project name> [commit or branch (optional)]
```

it will only recognize `jams`, `chat`, or `todo` as project names.
